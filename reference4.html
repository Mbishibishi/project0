        <p>The Great Wall of China is a series of fortifications made of stone,
            brick, tamped earth, wood, and other materials, generally built along
            an east-to-west line across the historical northern borders of China to
            protect the Chinese states and empires against the raids and invasions
            of the various nomadic groups of the Eurasian Steppe with an eye to expansion.
            Several walls were being built as early as the 7th century BC; these, later
            joined together and made bigger and stronger, are collectively referred to as
            the Great Wall. Especially famous is the wall built in 220 to 206 BC by
            Qin Shi Huang, the first Emperor of China. Little of that wall remains.
            The Great Wall has been rebuilt, maintained, and enhanced over various
            (1368 to 1644).</p>
        <br>
        <p>Apart from defense, other purposes of the Great Wall have included border
            controls, allowing the imposition of duties on goods transported along the
            Silk Road, regulation or encouragement of trade and the control of immigration
            and emigration. Furthermore, the defensive characteristics of the Great Wall
            were enhanced by the construction of watch towers, troop barracks, garrison
            stations, signaling capabilities through the means of smoke or fire, and the
            fact that the path of the Great Wall also served as a transportation corridor.</p>
        <br>
        <p>The frontier walls built by different dynasties have multiple courses.
            Collectively, they stretch from Dandong in the east to Lop Lake in the west,
            from present-day Sino-Russian border in the north to Qinghai in the south;
            along an arc that roughly delineates the edge of Mongolian steppe. A
            comprehensive archaeological survey, using advanced technologies, has
            concluded that the walls built by the Ming dynasty measure 8,850 km (5,500 mi).
            This is made up of 6,259 km (3,889 mi) sections of actual wall, 359 km (223 mi)
            of trenches and 2,232 km (1,387 mi) of natural defensive barriers such as hills
            and rivers. Another archaeological survey found that the entire wall with all
            of its branches measures out to be 21,196 km (13,171 mi). Today, the Great Wall
            is generally recognized as one of the most impressive architectural feats in history.</p>
