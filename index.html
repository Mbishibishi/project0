                The dry season lasts eight months or more, and the wet season 
                typically from less than one month to four months, depending on
                location. The southwestern Kalahari is the driest area, 
                in particular a small region located towards the west-southwest
                of Tsaraxaibis (Southeast of Namibia). The average annual
                rainfall ranging from around 110 mm (close to aridity) to more
                than 500 mm in some areas of the north and east. During summer 
                time in all regions rainfall may go with heavy thunderstorms. 
                In the driest and sunniest parts of the Kalahari, over 4,000 hours
                of sunshine are recorded annually on average.<a href="reference0.html"><span><h4 class="titles">Read more...</h4></span></a>
