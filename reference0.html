    <p><Strong>Central Kalahari Game Reserve</strong> is an extensive national park in the Kalahari 
      desert of Botswana. Established in 1961 it covers an area of 52,800 square 
      kilometres (20,400 sq mi) (larger than the Netherlands, and almost 10% of 
      Botswana's total land area), making it the second largest game reserve in 
      the world.</p>

          <figcaption style= "text-align: center"> The location of the Central Kalahari Game Reserve on the African continent. </figcaption>
        </figure>

    <p>The park contains wildlife such as South African giraffe, bush elephant,
       white rhino, cape buffalo, spotted hyena, brown hyena, honey badger,
        meerkat, yellow mongoose, warthog, South African cheetah, caracal, Cape
         wild dog, black-backed jackal, bat-eared fox, cape fox, African leopard, 
         lion, blue wildebeest, plains zebra, common eland, sable antelope, gemsbok,
          springbok, steenbok, impala, greater kudu, aardvark, cape ground squirrel,
           cape hare, cape porcupine, chacma baboon, red hartebeest and ostrich. The
            land is mostly flat, and gently undulating covered with bush and grasses
             covering the sand dunes, and areas of larger trees. Many of the river 
             valleys are fossilized with salt pans. Four fossilized rivers meander 
             through the reserve including Deception Valley which began to form 
             around 16,000 years ago.</p>

        <p>The Bushmen, or San, have inhabited the lands for thousands of years since
         they roamed the area as nomadic hunters. However, since the mid-1990s
          the Botswana government has tried to relocate the Bushmen from the 
          reserve, claiming they were a drain on financial resources despite 
          revenues from tourism. In 1997, three quarters of the entire San 
          population were relocated from the reserve, and in October 2005 the 
          government had resumed the forced relocation into resettlement camps 
          outside of the park leaving only about 250 permanent occupiers. 
          In 2006 a Botswana court proclaimed the eviction illegal and affirmed 
          the Bushmen's right to return to living in the reserve. However, as of 
          2015 most Bushmen are blocked from access to their traditional lands in 
          the reserve. A nationwide ban on hunting made it illegal for the Bushmen
           to practice their traditional hunter-gatherer lifestyle, despite 
           allowing private game ranches to provide hunting opportunities for 
           tourists.</p>

        <p>In 2014 a diamond mine operated by Gem Diamonds opened in the southeast
           portion of the reserve. The company estimated that the mine could yield
            $4.9 billion worth of diamonds. The Rapaport Diamond Report, a 
            diamond-industry pricing guide, stated, "Ghaghoo's launch was not 
            without controversy [...] given its location on the ancestral land 
            of the Bushmen".</p>
        
        <p>A huge bush fire in and around the park in the middle of September 2008 
        burnt around 80 percent of the reserve. The origin of the fire remains 
        unknown. </p>
