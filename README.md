Web Programming with Python and JavaScript

Hi CS50 staff,

The website talks about my five favourite touristic places. While writing it, I focused more on programming than the content of the website itself. By that I mean that I copied most of text content from other sites just to complete my the programming assigment, but I built up my own styles and structure.  The index.html page is the home page. Each page among reference0, reference1, reference2, reference3, reference4 files, talks about an individual page. I tend to focus more on the historical facts about the places, and also a little bit of geography. But the main purpose is actully demonstrating the programming skills I learned in the first two lectures. The reference5 file talks a little bit about my self, the purpose of the website and provides where I copied the text contents. I included two purely css files(styling and styling1.) I also included one a sass file, styles.scss, which was compiled into styles.css. The rest consists of photos that I used throughout the website.

In the screencast video I uploaded, of which I also included the URL in the submitted form, I walk you through the website to show how it functions in the browser. I would also like to inform the staff that I made a few modifications on the kalahari and oia pages. I added a few paddings to better align the titles within the dimgray backgrounds, which looked awkward in the video. I am saying this here because it is difficult for me to edit the video with the software I used. I apologize for that.

Thank you!
