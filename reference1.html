<section>
        <p>Chefchaouen or Chaouen, as it is often called by Moroccans is a popular
            tourist destination because of its proximity to Tangier and the Spanish
            enclave of Ceuta. There are approximately two hundred hotels catering to the
            summer influx of European tourists. One distinction possessed by Chefchaouen
            is its blue-rinsed houses and buildings.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Chefchaouen is a popular shopping destination as well, as it offers many
            native handicrafts that are not available elsewhere in Morocco, such as wool
            garments and woven blankets. The goat cheese native to the area is also
            popular with tourists.</p>
        <br>
        <p>The countryside around it has a reputation for being a prolific source of
            kief. The Chefchaouen region is one of the main producers of cannabis in
            Morocco. A nearby attraction is the Kef Toghobeit Cave, one of the deepest
            caves in Africa.</p>
        <br>
        <p></p>Chefchaouen's blue walls are a popular subject of interest. There are several
        theories as to why the walls were painted blue. One popular theory is that the
        blue keeps mosquitos away, another is that Jews introduced the blue when they
        took refuge from Hitler in the 1930s. The blue is said to symbolize the sky
        and heaven, and serve as a reminder to lead a spiritual life.</p>
        <br>
        <p>The growing tourist industry is geared especially towards Spanish tourists,
            who are numerous during great Catholic feasts like Semana Santa and Christmas.</p>
        <br>
        <p>The beauty of Chefchaouen's mountainous surroundings are enhanced by the
            contrast of the brightly painted medina (old town). It is this beauty and
            the relaxed atmosphere of the town that makes Chefchaouen very attractive to
            visitors.</p>
        <br>
        <p>The main square in the medina is lined with cafes and filled to the brim
            with locals and tourist mingling easily. Another reason why backpackers
            love Chefchaouen is the easy availability of drugs. Tourism in Chaouen is
            driven by its reputation as center of the marijuana plantations region in
            north Morocco. During the summer approximately 200 hotels cater to the influx
            of European tourists.</p>
