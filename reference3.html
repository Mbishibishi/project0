<p>The settlement of Oia had been mentioned in various travel reports before the 
    beginning of Venetian rule, when Marco Sanudo founded the Duchy of Naxos in 
    1207 and feudal rule was instituted on Santorini. Under the da Corogna 
    family, Agios Nikolaos Kastell (Καστέλι του Αγίου Νικολάου), also called 
    Apanomeria (Απανωμερία), was one of five local citadels. Its residential keep, 
    Goulas, is now in the oldest part of the town, on its southwestern edge.


In 1537, Hayreddin Barbarossa conquered the Aegean islands and placed them under 
Sultan Selim II. However, Santorini remained under the Crispo family until 
1566, passing then to Joseph Nasi and after his death in 1579 to the Ottoman 
Empire.

From the 16th to the 19th century, the settlement was designated Apanomeria on 
maps. In the mid-17th century, Jean de Thévenot uses the name Castelli San Nicolas. 
The name was changed to Oia in the second half of the 19th century.

In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the town was a mariners town that 
flourished as a result of seaborne trade throughout the Mediterranean, particularly 
as part of the trade route between Russia and Alexandria. In 1890 Oia had 
approximately 2,500 residents and approximately 130 sailing ships. There was a 
wharf in the bay of Armeni. Excellent wine was produced in quantity in the 
hinterland and exported to France amongst other places. However, the arrival 
of steam and the concentration of shipping at Piraeus caused the town's seagoing 
trade to collapse, and agriculture also diminished as increasing emigration took 
place, especially to Piraeus and Laurium. The economy of the town declined in the 
early 20th century on account of wars, economic depression and over extraction of 
fish resources.

The 7.8 magnitude earthquake on 9 July 1956 caused considerable damage. The 
epicentre of the strongest aftershock (magnitude 7.2) was located off the northern 
coast of Santorini. The earthquake was followed by renewed emigration, and in 
1977 Oia had only 306 inhabitants. After the earthquake, the village redeveloped 
into an attractive tourist town of the Cyclades, and is known as a "picture perfect"
town which gets crowded with people during the summer season.

<p>Oia is a scenic village on the north west edge of the Santorini island within 
    the Cyclades. It extends for almost 2 kilometres (1.2 mi) along the northern 
    edge of the caldera that forms the island of Santorini, at a height of between 
    70 and 100 metres (230 and 330 ft) above sea level. Immediately to the east is 
    Phinikia (Φοινικιά; Finikia), and about 500 metres (550 yd) to the north is 
    Tholos (Θόλος). Amoudi Bay lies below the town. The small fishing village of 
    Ormos Armeni (Όρμος Αρμένης) lies below Oia to the south and is reached via 
    steps. There is a ferry connection to Therasia from the harbour village of 
    Ormos Ammoudi (Όρμος Αμμουδιού; also spelled Amoudi) to the west. There 
    are 300 steps down to the port from Oia. The small island of Agios Nikolaos 
    lies to the southwest.</p> 
    
    
<p>It is built on the steep slope of the caldera and the houses and restaurants 
    are built into niches carved into the caldebra on the seaward side. There are 
    narrow passageways and a central square. The sun light hours in this village 
    are much longer than in the Fira town. Its paths are very narrow and hence gets 
    congested during the tourist season. The idyllic surroundings of the town 
    have a complex of white washed, blue domed churches and charming, traditional 
    Cycladic houses and cave houses that are carved into the rock face on top of 
    the cliff. It is set in a location which provides excellent views of the sunset 
    over the caldera. To the southwest, the Bay of Armeni, reachable from the town 
    on foot or by mule, was once an important boat-building centre. Small repairs 
    are now done on a single wharf. Excursion boats for trips around the island and 
    ferries to Therasia leave from here. The harbour of Ammoudi on the western side 
    of the town is reached by steep stairs north of Fort Londsa; there are a few 
    tavernas and a pebble beach.

    The village is located on top of a hill, at about 150 metres (490 ft) elevation, 
    and known as the "Eagles nest" from where Palia and Nea Kameni volcanoes are 
    seen and also the island of Thirassia. It is situated to the north of the 
    island and Fira is at distance of 11 kilometres (6.8 mi). The main street 
    in the town, in the central square, is the main trekking path which is cobbled, 
    called the "Nikalaou Namikaou", which goes up the hill winding round the 
    caldebra. The island is reached from Fira which is the transport terminus of 
    the island. Caldera boat cruise options are available from either Oia or 
    Fira.</p>
