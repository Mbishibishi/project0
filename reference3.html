        <p><strong>Oia</strong> is a scenic village on the north west edge of the Santorini island within
            the Cyclades. It extends for almost 2 kilometres (1.2 mi) along the northern
            edge of the caldera that forms the island of Santorini, at a height of between
            70 and 100 metres (230 and 330 ft) above sea level. Immediately to the east is
            Phinikia (Φοινικιά; Finikia), and about 500 metres (550 yd) to the north is
            Tholos (Θόλος). Amoudi Bay lies below the town. The small fishing village of
            Ormos Armeni (Όρμος Αρμένης) lies below Oia to the south and is reached via
            steps. There is a ferry connection to Therasia from the harbour village of
            Ormos Ammoudi (Όρμος Αμμουδιού; also spelled Amoudi) to the west. There
            are 300 steps down to the port from Oia. The small island of Agios Nikolaos
            lies to the southwest.</p>

        <p>It is built on the steep slope of the caldera and the houses and restaurants
            are built into niches carved into the caldebra on the seaward side. There are
            narrow passageways and a central square. The sun light hours in this village
            are much longer than in the Fira town. Its paths are very narrow and hence gets
            congested during the tourist season. The idyllic surroundings of the town
            have a complex of white washed, blue domed churches and charming, traditional
            Cycladic houses and cave houses that are carved into the rock face on top of
            the cliff. It is set in a location which provides excellent views of the sunset
            over the caldera. To the southwest, the Bay of Armeni, reachable from the town
            on foot or by mule, was once an important boat-building centre. Small repairs
            are now done on a single wharf. Excursion boats for trips around the island and
            ferries to Therasia leave from here. The harbour of Ammoudi on the western side
            of the town is reached by steep stairs north of Fort Londsa; there are a few
            tavernas and a pebble beach.

            The village is located on top of a hill, at about 150 metres (490 ft) elevation,
            and known as the "Eagles nest" from where Palia and Nea Kameni volcanoes are
            seen and also the island of Thirassia. It is situated to the north of the
            island and Fira is at distance of 11 kilometres (6.8 mi). The main street
            in the town, in the central square, is the main trekking path which is cobbled,
            called the "Nikalaou Namikaou", which goes up the hill winding round the
            caldebra. The island is reached from Fira which is the transport terminus of
            the island. Caldera boat cruise options are available from either Oia or
            Fira.</p>



        <h4 class="oia-titles" style="text-align: center"> Highlights of Oia's history.</h4>
        <nav class="flexBox">


            <div><p>The settlement of Oia had been mentioned in various travel reports before the
                beginning of Venetian rule, when Marco Sanudo founded the Duchy of Naxos in
                1207 and feudal rule was instituted on Santorini. Under the da Corogna
                family, Agios Nikolaos Kastell (Καστέλι του Αγίου Νικολάου), also called
                Apanomeria (Απανωμερία), was one of five local citadels. Its residential keep,
                Goulas, is now in the oldest part of the town, on its southwestern edge.</p></div>


            <div><p>In 1537, Hayreddin Barbarossa conquered the Aegean islands and placed them under
                Sultan Selim II. However, Santorini remained under the Crispo family until
                1566, passing then to Joseph Nasi and after his death in 1579 to the Ottoman
                Empire.

                From the 16th to the 19th century, the settlement was designated Apanomeria on
                maps. In the mid-17th century, Jean de Thévenot uses the name Castelli San Nicolas.
                The name was changed to Oia in the second half of the 19th century.</p></div>

        <nav class="flexBox">
            <div>In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the town was a mariners town that
                flourished as a result of seaborne trade throughout the Mediterranean, particularly
                as part of the trade route between Russia and Alexandria. In 1890 Oia had
                approximately 2,500 residents and approximately 130 sailing ships. There was a
                wharf in the bay of Armeni. Excellent wine was produced in quantity in the
                hinterland and exported to France amongst other places. However, the arrival
                of steam and the concentration of shipping at Piraeus caused the town's seagoing
                trade to collapse, and agriculture also diminished as increasing emigration took
                place, especially to Piraeus and Laurium. The economy of the town declined in the
                early 20th century on account of wars, economic depression and over extraction of
                fish resources.</div>

            <div>
                The 7.8 magnitude earthquake on 9 July 1956 caused considerable damage. The
                epicentre of the strongest aftershock (magnitude 7.2) was located off the northern
                coast of Santorini. The earthquake was followed by renewed emigration, and in
                1977 Oia had only 306 inhabitants. After the earthquake, the village redeveloped
                into an attractive tourist town of the Cyclades, and is known as a "picture perfect"
                town which gets crowded with people during the summer season.
