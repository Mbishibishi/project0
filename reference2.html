    <p>Settlement in Rothenburg's area dates back to 970 AD when a parish developed in
        Detwang (today a suburb of Rothenburg).

        1070 - The first castle at Rothenburg was built for the counts of Rothenburg in a
        nice spot overlooking the Tauber valley. After the counts family died off, the
        Hohenstaufen dynasty took possession of the castle.

        Around 1170 - A Staufer castle was errected close to the old castle, and the town
        developed. Only 2 years later Rothenburg received city rights and the first
        fortification was built.

        Markusturm, the Weiße Turm and Röderbogen are remnants of this first fortification.
        Actually, you'll find them within the old town now.

        From 1204 - First urban extension. The town fortification grew from 1400m to 2400m
        in length.

        1250 - The foundation stone for the gothic town hall was laid. The eastern wing
        burnt down 1501, and was replaced by the magnificient renaissance building that
        has been dominating the market square until today. The white building with the
        elegant clock tower is still the original part of the town hall.</p>

            </figure>

    <p>1274 - Rothenburg became a free imperial city which included more rights & autonomy
        and the city developed even more.

        1311 - Construction for the mighty St. Jakobs Kirche (St. James church) started.
        It took more than 100 years until the monument was completed and consecrated in
        1484.

        St. Jacob's Church features impressive religious art, including the famous
        wood-carved altarpiece by Tilman Riemenschneider and the Zwölfbotenaltar
        (Twelve Apostels Altar) with colourful paintings by Friedrich Herlin.

        1356 - An earthquake destroyed both castles, the Burgtor bastion was built to
        protect this part of the city.

        Around 1400 - Rothenburg's heyday during mayor Heinrich Töppler's term of office.
        His home, the small Töppler castle, can still be visited in the Tauber valley.</p>

    <div class="col align-self-start">
            

    <p>The 30 years war from 1618 to 1648 (a horrible dispute between Catholics and
        Protestants) caused misery & destruction in Germany, and in Rothenburg ob der
        Tauber as well.
        1631 - General Tilly, leading a 40,000 imperial Catholic army, asked for winter
        quarter in Rothenburg. The city's council and senators denied the request and
        decided to defend Rothenburg and its Protestant belief. Rothenburg's heavy
        fortification could withstand a siege, however, after the gunpowder tower blew
        off and destroyed parts of the city wall, Rothenburg had to surrender.

        Tilly's troops took revenge for the 300 soldiers they had lost in the short
        battle. They plundered the town and left three months later. Additionally,
        the Black Plague depleted the population drastically, so Rothenburg fell into
        insignificance for over two centuries.

        Legend has it that the former mayor Nusch's master draught (Meistertrunk)
        saved Rothenburg from total destruction. This has never been proved.

        The lack of influence, power & wealth prevented further developments and
        changes for a long time, and preserved the architecture of the 16th century
        in Rothenburg. </p>

    <p>1802 - Rothenburg lost its independence and became part of Bavaria.
        In the 19th century painters discovered the romantic town. Through
        their work, the historic beauty of Rothenburg became known around
        the world, and tourism developed slowly.

        Thankfully, Rothenburg's citizens and government recognised the
        importance of their well-preserved town. Laws prevented anyone to
        make changes to their houses. Modern Rothenburg developed outside
        the city walls.

        1945 - Rothenburg was partly destroyed by an American bombing raid.

        </figure>
        The US General John McCloy was able to prevent a planned artillery
        attack, and the German troops stationed in Rothenburg surrendered to
        avoid even more destruction in the town.

        With international donations all destroyed buildings and the damaged
        parts of the fortification wall were rebuilt and feature commemorative
        bricks with the names of contributors.</p>
